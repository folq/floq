# Folq ghetto local development

1. `yarn install`
2. Create `config/apps.json` and add:

``` json
[
    {
        "short_name": "timestamp",
        "name": "Timef√∏ring",
        "type": "app",
        "script": "http://localhost:8080/app.bundle.js",
        "config": {
            "apiUri": "http://localhost:3001"
        }
    }
]
```
3. 
Use this to connect to the locally running `floq-db`
``` sh
API_TOKEN_SECRET="devModeSuperSecretdevModeSuperSecretdevModeSuperSecret"
yarn start
```

# Blank recipe
1. `yarn install`
2. Create the file apps.json, e.g. `cp config/apps.json.dev config/apps.json`
   - You have the possibility to add/remove modules from `apps.json`
   - The selected modules have to be running at the specified endpoints/ports
3. To make API-calls from your application, you need correct google-tokens, which are created using env-variables. If you go to `src/auth.js`, open the `common` library, then the `auth.js` file in common, you can see it's trying to fetch `process.env.API_TOKEN_SECRET`. You need to set this env-variable (either directly in this file, or any other way you prefer), otherwise querying the API won't work. These are stored in 1password.
4. `yarn start`
